                question: "Is Brahman (Ultimate Reality) personal (Saguna Brahman) or impersonal (Nirguna Brahman)?",
                options: [
                    "Personal only - like Vishnu or Shiva",
                    "Impersonal only - formless and beyond attributes",
                    "Both personal and impersonal aspects",

                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                school: "Vedanta",
                explanation: "Most Vedanta schools reconcile this by teaching that Nirguna Brahman is the ultimate reality, while Saguna Brahman is how humans relate to the divine.",
                scripture: "Brahma Sutras 3.2.11-14 discusses both aspects of Brahman"

                    "Completely real - part of Brahman's creation",
                    "Unreal - only Brahman exists",
                    "Illusory appearance - not ultimately real",
                    "Real but temporary - like a dream that exists while it lasts"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 3,
                school: "Metaphysics",
                explanation: "Different schools vary: Advaita says world is mithya (apparent reality), Vishishtadvaita says it's real but dependent on Brahman, Dvaita says it's as real as Brahman but separate.",
                scripture: "Mandukya Upanishad 7 describes the world as 'neither real nor unreal'"

                ],
                correctAnswer: 3,
                school: "Yoga",
                explanation: "The Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 12) validates all paths, though different traditions emphasize different approaches based on individual nature (svabhava).",
                scripture: "Bhagavad Gita 12.5: 'For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.'"
            },
            {
                question: "Can women and lower castes achieve moksha directly, or do they need to be reborn as upper-caste males first?",
                options: [
                    "Only upper-caste males can achieve moksha",
                    "All can achieve moksha but caste affects the path",
                    "Caste/gender irrelevant for moksha",
                    "The concept of moksha itself needs reformation"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                school: "Social Dharma",
                explanation: "While traditional texts sometimes restrict moksha, bhakti movements and modern Hinduism generally accept all can attain liberation regardless of birth.",
                scripture: "Bhagavad Gita 9.32: 'For those who take refuge in Me, O Arjuna, even if they are of sinful birth... they attain the supreme goal.'"
            },

            // Caste System
            {
                question: "Is the caste system (varna) divinely ordained or a social construct?",
                options: [
                    "Divinely ordained in Vedas for social harmony",
                    "Originally by guna/karma but corrupted into birth-based",
                    "Purely social construct with no divine sanction",
                    "A colonial misinterpretation of Indian society"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                school: "Dharma",
                explanation: "While the Bhagavad Gita (4.13) describes varna by guna/karma, in practice it became hereditary. Modern reformers reject birth-based caste.",
                scripture: "Bhagavad Gita 4.13: 'The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma...'"
            },

                    "Government affirmative action",
                    "Complete rejection of caste identity",

                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                school: "Social Reform",
                explanation: "Most Hindu reformers (from Buddha to Ambedkar) have worked within tradition to address caste issues, though approaches vary widely.",
                scripture: "Rig Veda 10.90 (Purusha Sukta) is often cited regarding varna origins"
            },

            // Deities and Worship
            {
                question: "Are all Hindu deities (devas) manifestations of one Supreme Being or distinct entities?",
                options: [
                    "All are manifestations of one God (Brahman)",
                    "Distinct entities with their own domains",

                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                school: "Theology",
                explanation: "The Vedantic view is that all deities are manifestations of Brahman, though popular worship often treats them as distinct.",
                scripture: "Rig Veda 1.164.46: 'Truth is One, though the wise call it by many names.'"
            },

                question: "Is idol worship essential or can Hinduism be practiced without murtis (images)?",
                options: [
                    "Essential - murtis are divine manifestations",
                    "Helpful but not absolutely necessary",
                    "A later development not in original Vedas",
                    "Potentially distracting from formless worship"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                school: "Worship",
                explanation: "While murti puja is central to most Hindu practice, traditions like Arya Samaj reject it, and the Upanishads emphasize formless worship.",
                scripture: "Shvetashvatara Upanishad 4.19-20 describes both formless and with-form aspects of God"

                    "A metaphorical teaching about consequences"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                school: "Karma",
                explanation: "Classical Hinduism views karma as an impersonal law (though some theistic schools see God as overseeing the process).",

                correctAnswer: 2,
                school: "Bhakti",
                explanation: "Bhakti traditions emphasize grace (especially in Vaishnavism), while classical yoga emphasizes personal effort. Most accept both play roles.",
